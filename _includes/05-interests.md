## Main Interests

### Programming

The main programming that I use is **C++** and **CMake** :computer:.
I also like automating processes to free up my time to do other projects !

I'm currently going though *GitHub tutorial* in [GitHub Lab](https://lab.github.com/).

### Music

I love to play guitar :guitar: even if I don't always make the time for it, and I'm currently learning piano :musical_keyboard:.

Moreover, as [Expressivee](https://www.expressivee.com/), the company I currently work for is an company creating software and hardware dedicated to the music creators, I also have the opportunity to play with other instruments and software dedicated to music.
